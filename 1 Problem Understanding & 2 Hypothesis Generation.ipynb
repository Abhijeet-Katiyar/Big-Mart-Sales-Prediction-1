    "The data scientists at BigMart have collected 2013 sales data for 1559 products across 10 stores in different cities. Also, certain attributes of each product and store have been defined. The **aim** is to build a predictive model and find out the sales of each product at a particular store.<br>\n",

    "## Hypotheses about Product:\n",
    "1. **Region:** A particular product maybe liked at some stores and not liked at some stores because of the region.\n",
    "2. **Age Group:** A product may be preferred by a particular age group and not preferred by another, so we need to see what is the age group of people living in the viscinity of a store and keep more products related to their needs.\n",
    "3. **Cheap and Best:** Cheap as well as branded products have a better chance of selling.\n",
    "4. **Discounts:** Products along which discounts are given or products under an offer have a better chance of getting sold.\n",
    "5. **Wealthy People- Expensive Products; Middle Class- Cheaper Products** If the people living near the store are wealthy then would prefer buying branded and expensive products, while if the store is in a region where the people of lower to middle class live then their preference will be considerably cheaper products.\n",
    "6. **Attractive Packaging:** A product having an attractive packaging will be sold more as compared to products having not so good packaging.\n",
    "7. **Location of the Product in Store:** A place where the item is kept, and with which item it is kept, highly determines whether it will be sold or not. If a product is placed at a place where customers cannot see it easily however good the product maybe it may not be sold."

    "4. **Marketing:** The store which has a proper marketing strategy and budget will have better income.\n",
    "5. **Product Variety:** The store which offers a good variety as well as has better options for customers to select from different brands will have better income.\n",
    "6. **Location:** The income of the store will be dependent on whether the store is in a Tier1, Tier2, Tier3 city.\n",
    "7. **Friendly Staff:** If the store has staff which has friendly towards it's customers then, customers are more likely to come again to the same store.\n"
